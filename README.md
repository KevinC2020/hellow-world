## lab-brackets-git: How to use Brackets-Git
     
This is a demonstration (teaching) repository that explains how to manage a GitHub repository from within the Brackets text editor using the Brackets-Git extension.


The README.md should contain certain specific things:

    A title

    An Introduction (what the project is for)

    A Table of Contents (TOC)

    Instructions for use

    Installation instruction (if required)

    Links to other documentation (if not all contained here)
